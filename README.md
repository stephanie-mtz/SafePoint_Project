# SafePoint_Project
NASA: Space Apps Challenge

With this project, we seek to protect the lives of families and individuals around the world by providing them with real-time information on the progress of the Covid-19 in their communities and places they frequent, to reduce the impacts of human factors in the expansion or spread of the Covid-19, which can affect our daily lifestyles.
